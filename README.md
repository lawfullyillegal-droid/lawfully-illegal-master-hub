#### Statutory References
- **UCC § 1-201(24)**: "Money" means a medium of exchange currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government

2. **Fiat Money**: Government-issued currency without intrinsic value
3. **Credit Money**: Represents a claim on future money (checks, promissory notes)
